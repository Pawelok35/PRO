# In Stats We Trust

A football analytics project focused on the Premier League, built on advanced metrics such as xG (expected goals), xPTS (expected points), recent form, and betting odds.

**Goal:** To enable match analysis, performance simulations, and backtesting of betting strategies using real-world data and a structured, data-driven approach.

### Features (planned or in progress):
- Import and transform raw match data from Excel files
- Calculate team power ratings using multiple weighted metrics
- Analyze matches and full rounds using form, xG, and opponent strength
- Run Monte Carlo simulations to estimate expected outcomes
- Backtest betting strategies (e.g., +2/-10, value bets)
- Export reports and strategy performance logs
